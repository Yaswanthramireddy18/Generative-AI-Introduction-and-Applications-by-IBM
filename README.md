## 🌐 Course Overview

Generative AI is transforming the way we work, communicate, and create. Through this course, I learned how generative AI models—such as large language models (LLMs)—can generate text, images, audio, video, and even code.

I explored the fundamentals and evolution of generative AI and its differences from discriminative AI. I discovered how it is being applied across industries, and I experimented with tools like **ChatGPT**, **DALL·E**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **IBM Generative AI Classroom** through hands-on labs.

## 🧠 What I Learned

By the end of this course, I was able to:

- Describe what generative AI is and how it differs from discriminative AI.
- Identify the capabilities and real-world use cases of generative AI.
- Understand applications across various sectors like IT, healthcare, education, finance, and HR.
- Use popular tools and models for generating text, images, code, audio, and video.
